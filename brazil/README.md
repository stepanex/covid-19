## BREAKING CHANGE 2.0:

The government took the page with official statistics down, on http://plataforma.saude.gov.br/novocoronavirus/. The old data had suspicious cases and not infected data. The new version of the data have only infected and deaths. The following fields are gone: `suspiciousCases`, `testedNotInfected`, `suspiciousCasesByRegion`, `testedNotInfectedByRegion`. There's a new field called `version` that is effectively a tag for the version of the data. If it changes, the version will change.
